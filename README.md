Prerequisites
Before you can run a Java project, you will need to have the following software installed on your computer:

Java Development Kit (JDK): This is required to compile and run Java programs. You can download the latest version of JDK from the official Oracle website here.
Integrated Development Environment (IDE): This is optional, but highly recommended for writing and organizing your Java code. Examples of popular Java IDEs include Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans.

Running the Project

Once you have the prerequisites installed, you can follow these steps to run the Java project:

Open your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the Java project is stored.

Compile the Java source code by running the following command:

javac transactions.java

This will compile the Java source files required to run the program.

Run the Java program by executing the following command:

java transactions

After run the program, you will be asked to enter the path of the file and the number of the points being used.
