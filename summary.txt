1.Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?
For this project, I chose to use Java because it is the language I am most familiar with, and it is a widely-used language that 
has plenty of good libraries available. I used java.util.Instant to deal with the comparison of time stamps since it provides a 
simple and efficient way to work with time stamps. PriorityQueue was used to put the records of gaining points into an ascending 
order based on time stamps, which were then polled by order to achieve the requirement of using the earliest points first. 
HashMap was used to store the remaining points of each payer. Finally, I used the opencsv library for reading and parsing the CSV file, 
as it provides a convenient and efficient way to work with CSV files in Java.

2.What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?
One advantage of my solution is that it is simple and easy to use, with clear instructions that allow users to get the expected return 
easily. However, one disadvantage is that my solution only handles the specific input format provided in the prompt, and may not be 
easily adaptable to other formats. Additionally, it assumes that the input CSV file is well-formed and does not handle malformed inputs 
gracefully.

3.What has been your favorite school or personal project thus far? What about it challenged you?
My favorite project thus far has been the most recent one I completed in school, which allowed users to search for Reddit posts that 
included certain keywords inputted by the users. It was my favorite project because it was the first team project I worked on, which 
was a completely different experience for me. Working with a team allowed me to see how different people can bring unique perspectives 
and skills to the table, and how important communication and collaboration are in achieving a common goal. The project challenged me in 
terms of coordinating with team members, managing timelines , and integrating different parts of the codebase. It was a 
valuable learning experience that taught me not only technical skills, but also soft skills such as teamwork, leadership, and 
problem-solving.
